This repository contains the implementation of the H-Lo-MLP model and associated analysis scripts described in our paper:

"Multiregional neural sensing for precisely predicting motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinsonâ€™s disease"

# Model Overview

H-Lo-MLP is a specialized neural network architecture designed for predicting motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease using multiregional neural sensing data. 
The model incorporates a multi-loss function strategy to effectively handle open-set data, improving prediction accuracy and robustness.

For detailed information on the model architecture and loss function calculations, please refer to our research paper.
